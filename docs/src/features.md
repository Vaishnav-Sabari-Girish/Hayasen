# Features

This section details the key features and capabilities provided by the `hayasen` library, along with
future development plans.

## Current Features

- `mpu9250` - Enables comprehensive support for the MPU9250 motion sensor. This includes functionalities
for reading accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer data, as well as configuration options for various
operating modes. (Enabled by default)
